Udacity Data Architect Nanodegree submissions

## Project list

### Project 1 - Designing an HR Database

> Design, build, and populate a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at the imaginary Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. This project will start with a request from the HR Manager. From there, you will need to design a database using the foundational principles of data architecture that is best suited to the department's needs. You will go through the steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams, and finally creating the database itself. This project is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.
